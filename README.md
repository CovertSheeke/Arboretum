# Floral Card Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Arboretum simulation! This is an exciting digital adaptation of a unique card game that combines strategy, luck, and a treehugging theme. Currently, the game runs as a fully automated simulation, with the computer making random moves for all players. However, this is just the beginning of our ambitious project!

## Current Features

- Supports 2-4 players
- Automated gameplay with random decision-making
- Unique deck generation based on the number of players
- Complex scoring system involving paths of increasing card ranks
- Colorful console output for visualizing the game state

## Future Ambitions

While the current version serves as a proof of concept, our vision for this project is much grander:

1. **Human Players**: Implement an interactive mode where human players can make decisions.
2. **Graphical User Interface**: Develop a visually appealing UI to replace the current console output.
3. **Intelligent AI**: Create smarter computer opponents using advanced algorithms.
4. **Online Multiplayer**: Enable players to compete against each other over the internet.
5. **Mobile Version**: Adapt the game for iOS and Android platforms.
6. **Customization**: Allow players to create custom decks and game rules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CovertSheeke/Arboretum.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Game

To run a single game simulation:

```
node run_one_game.js
```

This will execute a game with two players (Alice and Victor) and display the results in the console.
